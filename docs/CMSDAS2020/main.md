# Tau long exercise for the 2020 CMSDAS

After having performed the [short exercises](https://github.com/CMSDAS/tau-short-exercise), you have learned how hadronic &tau;
lepton decays (&tau;<sub>h</sub> candidates) are reconstructed and discriminated against jets, electrons and muons at CMS.

The main target of this Tau long exercise is to make you familiar with the general procedure and aspects of an analysis from front to end,
using the measurement of the Z&rarr;&tau;&tau; cross-section as an example. The publication describing such an analysis,
[doi:10.1140/epjc/s10052-018-6146-9](https://doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-018-6146-9), was based on 2.3 fb<sup>-1</sup> of data collected in 2015 at
a center of mass energy &radic;s&#x305; = 13 TeV.

In the context of this exercise, you will do a simplified version of that measurement, but feel free to have a look at the paper for inspiration :).

This exercise is based on the [TauFW](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauFW) analysis framework and builds upon 2018 NanoAOD datasets.
The statistical inference is performed with [CombinedLimit](https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit),
[CombineHarvester](https://github.com/cms-analysis/CombineHarvester), and analysis-specific package [CMSDAS2020TauLong](https://github.com/ArturAkh/CMSDAS2020TauLong).

After this exercise you will learn, how to:

 + apply selection to preselected NanoAOD samples to produce flat n-tuples, maybe also create preselected NanoAOD yourself,
 + estimate QCD multi-jet background to the Z&rarr;&tau;&tau; selection in a data-driven way,
 + normalize your expected backgrounds and signals to match the events collected in data,
 + create control plots of various quantities calculated in the flat n-tuples,
 + apply corrections to the expected contributions to improve agreement between data and expectation,
 + refine selection requirements to enrich Z&rarr;&tau;&tau;,
 + make a simple estimate of energy scale corrections and uncertainties for &tau;<sub>h</sub> candidates,
 + create histograms in one inclusive category for statistical inference,
 + extend categorization by splitting the inclusive phase space with appropriate variables,
 + introduce normalization and shape uncertainties to the uncertainty model for the Z&rarr;&tau;&tau; cross-section measurement,
 + and calculate and plot the best-estimate for the cross-section.

After having finished this analysis, you are asked to present it as an analysis group to an audience in a symposium.

Following the good old rule *Do good things, and speak about it!*, it is important, that you invest time into the presentation to make it
understandable for an outside (particle) physicist, covering all main aspects of the analysis at the same time. For this reason, some tips and tricks
are summarized in an additional section:
